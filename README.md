1.	Problem Statement 
These statement is to apply artificial intelligence to improve production in the livestock industry.
Nowadays people are getting more aware of their health. Since almost 80% of the dairy industry comes under 
the unorganized sector it is the need of an hour to solve the problem of this industry. I hope to create 
a service that can solve the problem of the dairy industry and help to increase their revenue.

1.	Market/Business needs Assessment 
As we know 80% of the dairy industry comes under the unorganized sector. 70% urban and 30% rural milk does not meet the standards as per FSSAI.
Livestock owners face the problem of animal health, lower milk productivity and facing problems in claiming the insurance of animals, breeding of animals, 
trading of milch animals, also the problem of milk wastage. Therefore, by using AI technique, we aim to provide small businesses with useful 
insights from the available data and ways to generate more revenue.
